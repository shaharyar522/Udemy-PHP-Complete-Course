What you are going to learn on this section
1. Core PHP Programming Concepts
PHP Syntax and Basics:

Writing PHP code embedded within HTML.

Understanding how server-side scripts process data from forms.

Session Management:

Using session_start() to manage user sessions.

Storing and retrieving session data (e.g., checking if a user is logged in or saving a user's session across multiple pages).

Logging users in and out by setting and unsetting session variables.

Working with Global Variables:

Handling $_POST to retrieve form data securely.

Understanding the lifecycle of HTTP requests and how data is passed between client and server.



2. Database Connectivity Using MySQLi Procedural
Connecting to a MySQL Database:

Using mysqli_connect() to establish a connection to a MySQL database.

Handling connection errors and ensuring the app gracefully handles database-related issues.

SQL Query Execution:

Executing queries with MySQLi procedural functions such as mysqli_query() to interact with the database.

Performing CRUD operations:

Create: Inserting data into the database using INSERT queries.

Read: Retrieving data with SELECT queries.

Update: Modifying existing data using UPDATE queries.

Delete: Removing data using DELETE queries.

SQL Query Structure:

Writing SQL queries for basic user management and posts, learning the structure and clauses of SQL (e.g., SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN).



3. Sanitizing User Input
Escaping User Input with mysqli_real_escape_string():

Preventing SQL injection by using mysqli_real_escape_string() to sanitize user inputs before incorporating them into SQL queries.

Learning why input sanitization is necessary and how it protects web applications from common security vulnerabilities



4. Building a User Authentication System
User Registration:

Building a form to collect and process user input (username, email, and password).

Using password_hash() to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.

User Login:

Authenticating users by retrieving the stored password hash and using password_verify() to compare it with the entered password.

Redirecting users to protected pages (e.g., admin dashboard) once they are authenticated.

Session Management for User Authentication:

Maintaining the login state by storing the user’s information in the session (using $_SESSION).

Implementing secure access control by restricting access to specific pages (such as admin.php) based on the user’s session status.
